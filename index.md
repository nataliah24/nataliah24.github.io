## About Me

I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University-Heinz College with a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management. This experience has equipped me with the skills necessary for policy and data analysis, which I hope to apply to future opportunities. I am very passionate about immigrant rights, economic equity, environmental issues, and education.
